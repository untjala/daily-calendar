# Daily Calendar
### Description
For this challenge, my goal was to make additions to the starter code and create a calender to store events for different hours of the day. Upo launch, the user is show the current day as well as a schedule that is color blocked to indicate which hour of the day they are in. Users are able to log and save events, which are held in local stoarge.
