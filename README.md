# Daily Calendar
### Description
For this challenge, my goal was to make additions to the starter code and create a calendar to store events for different hours of the day. Upon launch, the user is shown the current day as well as a schedule that is color blocked to indicate which hour of the day they are in. Users can log and save events, which are held in local storage.
